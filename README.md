# Hello-World
Hey guys!

  I can't tell you my name, but I can tell you my initials, which are dp. I am another teen aspiring web-dev, whose ultimte goal is to make the Universe perfect. But before we dive into that philosophic bullshit, let me tell you something about myself.
  I live in India, Maharashtra, where everybody looks for profit and friends looksd for cooler friends. And I wasn't exactly cool. Growing up in a relatively middle-class family, arguments over money and when you didn't have money, you didn't have friends.
  
Bye
